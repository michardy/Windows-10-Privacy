# Windows-10-Privacy
This program helps turn off parts of Windows 10 that are privacy concerns.  More specifically this program turns off autostart for the "diagtrack" service, disables Windows 10 app advertising IDs, and Windows Wifi Sense.  

I cannot promise that this program will fully disable any of the above mentioned functions.  Furthermore I cannot promise that these are the only functions in Windows 10 that pose privacy risks.  If you have any new functions that you think that should be diasabled feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/michardy/Windows-10-Privacy/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/michardy/Windows-10-Privacy/pulls).
